The Grid
A digital frontier
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer
What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways?
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see
And then one day
I got in

 Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waitin' on this my whole life
These dreams be wakin' me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight?

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fuckin' nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word

Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryin' to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet and that's what the intuition is

When you hop back in the car, drive back to the crib
Run back to they arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline

And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's prime time
Heaven'll watch, God callin' from the hotlines
Why He keep givin' me hotlines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?

How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused

What you about on that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams

TechnologicThe Grid
A digital frontier
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer
What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways?
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see
And then one day
I got in

 Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waitin' on this my whole life
These dreams be wakin' me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight?

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fuckin' nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word

Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryin' to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet and that's what the intuition is

When you hop back in the car, drive back to the crib
Run back to they arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline

And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's prime time
Heaven'll watch, God callin' from the hotlines
Why He keep givin' me hotlines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?

How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused

What you about on that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams
