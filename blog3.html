<h1>Golang Appreciation Post</h1>
  <pre>
I love GoLang, it's simple. I will write more about it soon. Edit: (This statement was written in May 2025.)


I have been using Golang as my primarly backend language for about 3.5 months now. I never planned on learning 
it but got dragged into writing it for a house service at the Computer Science House (CSH) at RIT. Jumping straight 
into an unfamiliar codebase is not a good idea. But, I somehow was very, and I mean very, impressed by how Golang is 
written (could be because how good @wilnil writes it, lmao). That was it, I began writing more Golang and it grew onto me. 
I used it for my webserver that ran my personal notification module (a.k.a. zxcvHQSYNC). I liked the way Golang was written 
compared to other similar languages like Python. I am a Python hater. lol. Anyways, I like how easy concurrecy is built in 
the language, and channels and goroutines are really powerful tools. The addition of generics makes the language very usable.

The package manager is great. Even better than languages like Python (again, lol) honestly. The fast compiling times makes me 
feel like I am not fighting against the language to build something which  is a case with most languages like Java and C++. 
Lastly, it doesn't feel like pseudocode, which is a problem I have with a lot of higher level languages. Anyways, I would like 
expand on these topics sometime later:

      - Binary Executable
      - Automatic Garbage Collection
      - Concurrency Techniques
      - Networking (THIS)
